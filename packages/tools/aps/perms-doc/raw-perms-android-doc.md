### ACCEPT_HANDOVER

Added in [API level 28](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)

```
public static final [String](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String) ACCEPT_HANDOVER
```

Allows a calling app to continue a call which was started in another app. An example is a
video calling app that wants to continue a voice call on the user's mobile network.

When the handover of a call from one app to another takes place, there are two devices
which are involved in the handover; the initiating and receiving devices. The initiating
device is where the request to handover the call was started, and the receiving device is
where the handover request is confirmed by the other party.

This permission protects access to the
`[TelecomManager.acceptHandover(Uri, int, PhoneAccountHandle)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/TelecomManager#acceptHandover(android.net.Uri,%20int,%20android.telecom.PhoneAccountHandle))` which

public static final [String](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String) READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
```

Allows an application to read from external storage.

**Note:** Starting in API level 33, this permission has no
effect. If your app accesses other apps' media files, request one or more of these permissions
instead: [`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES),
[`READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO),
[`READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_AUDIO). Learn more about the
[storage
permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media#storage-permission) that are associated with media files.

This permission is enforced starting in API level 19. Before API level 19, this
permission is not enforced and all apps still have access to read from external storage.
You can test your app with the permission enforced by enabling *Protect USB
storage* under **Developer options** in the Settings app on a device running Android
4.1 or higher.

Also starting in API level 19, this permission is *not* required to
read or write files in your application-specific directories returned by
`[Context.getExternalFilesDir(String)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getExternalFilesDir(java.lang.String))` and
`[Context.getExternalCacheDir()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getExternalCacheDir())`.

Starting in API level 29, apps don't need to request this permission to access files in
their app-specific directory on external storage, or their own files in the
[`MediaStore`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore). Apps
shouldn't request this permission unless they need to access other apps' files in the
`MediaStore`. Read more about these changes in the
[scoped storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage#scoped-storage) section of the
developer documentation.

If *both* your [`minSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#min) and [`targetSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target) values are set to 3 or lower, the system implicitly
grants your app this permission. If you don't need this permission, be sure your [`targetSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target) is 4 or higher.

This is a soft restricted permission which cannot be held by an app it its
full form until the installer on record allowlists the permission.
Specifically, if the permission is allowlisted the holder app can access
external storage and the visual and aural media collections while if the
permission is not allowlisted the holder app can only access to the visual
and aural medial collections. Also the permission is immutably restricted
meaning that the allowlist state can be specified only at install time and
cannot change until the app is installed. For more details see
`[PackageInstaller.SessionParams.setWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(Set)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller.SessionParams#setWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(java.util.Set%3Cjava.lang.String%3E))`.

public static final [String](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String) READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED
```

Allows an application to read image or video files from external storage that a user has
selected via the permission prompt photo picker. Apps can check this permission to verify that
a user has decided to use the photo picker, instead of granting access to
`[READ_MEDIA_IMAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)` or `[READ_MEDIA_VIDEO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)`. It does not prevent apps from
accessing the standard photo picker manually. This permission should be requested alongside
`[READ_MEDIA_IMAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)` and/or `[READ_MEDIA_VIDEO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)`, depending on which type of media
is desired.

This permission will be automatically added to an app's manifest if the app requests
`[READ_MEDIA_IMAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)`, `[READ_MEDIA_VIDEO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)`, or `[ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION)`
regardless of target SDK. If an app does not request this permission, then the grant dialog
will return `PERMISSION_GRANTED` for `[READ_MEDIA_IMAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)` and/or
`[READ_MEDIA_VIDEO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)`, but the app will only have access to the media selected by the
user. This false grant state will persist until the app goes into the background.

Protection level: dangerous

Constant Value:
"android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED"

### READ_NEARBY_STREAMING_POLICY

security implications, it can have a negative impact on the
user experience by increasing the amount of time it takes the
system to start and allowing applications to have themselves
running without the user being aware of them. As such, you must
explicitly declare your use of this facility to make that visible
to the user.

`[WORKING_SET](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageStatsManager#STANDBY_BUCKET_WORKING_SET)` or
lower standby bucket.

If your app relies on exact alarms for core functionality, it can instead request
`[USE_EXACT_ALARM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_EXACT_ALARM)` once it targets API
`[Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#TIRAMISU)`. All apps using exact alarms for secondary

 **This is only intended for use by apps that rely on exact alarms for their core
functionality.** You should continue using `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` if your app needs
exact alarms for a secondary feature that users may or may not use within your app.

Keep in mind that this is a powerful permission and app stores may enforce policies to
audit and review the use of this permission. Such audits may involve removal from the app
store if the app is found to be misusing this permission.

able to request this permission. Note that only one of `USE_EXACT_ALARM` or
`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` should be requested on a device. If your app is already using
`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` on older SDKs but needs `USE_EXACT_ALARM` on SDK 33 and
above, then `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` should be declared with a max-sdk attribute, like:

```
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"
 	 android:maxSdkVersion="32" />

grants your app this permission. If you don't need this permission, be sure your [`targetSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target) is 16 or higher.

Protection level: dangerous

This is a hard restricted permission which cannot be held by an app until
the installer on record allowlists the permission. For more details see

```
public static final [String](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String) WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
```

Allows an application to write to external storage.

**Note:** If your app targets `[Build.VERSION_CODES.R](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#R)` or
higher, this permission has no effect.

If your app is on a device that runs API level 19 or higher, you don't need to declare
this permission to read and write files in your application-specific directories returned
by `[Context.getExternalFilesDir(String)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getExternalFilesDir(java.lang.String))` and
`[Context.getExternalCacheDir()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getExternalCacheDir())`.

Learn more about how to
[modify media
files](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media#update-other-apps-files) that your app doesn't own, and how to
[modify non-media files](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/documents-files)
that your app doesn't own.

If your app is a file manager and needs broad access to external storage files, then
the system must place your app on an allowlist so that you can successfully request the
[MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE%3E%3Ccode%20translate=) permission.

[`minSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/manage-all-files%3Emanaging%20all%20files%20on%20a%20storage%20device%3C/a%3E.%20%3Cp%3EIf%20%3Cem%3Eboth%3C/em%3E%20your%20%3Ca%20href%3D) and [`targetSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target) values are set to 3 or lower, the system implicitly
grants your app this permission. If you don't need this permission, be sure your [`targetSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target) is 4 or higher.

Protection level: dangerous

Constant Value:
"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
